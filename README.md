# 🚢 NCLH Cruise Ship Fuel Analytics Dashboard

A Streamlit-based interactive analytics dashboard that analyzes fuel consumption, warm-up efficiency, and operational delays for cruise ships under major subsidiaries such as Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas.

## 🔍 Overview

This dashboard provides insights into:
- Engine warm-up efficiency across different ships and subsidiaries
- Fuel usage patterns and associated costs
- Financial impact of port congestion and inefficient warm-ups

All data used in this application is **synthetically generated** using Python libraries like `numpy` and `pandas`. The generation process simulates real-world conditions such as:
- Varying port traffic levels
- Randomized fuel usage and cost values
- Engine warm-up times and their deviation from optimal thresholds
- Sailing delays caused by busy ports
---

## 🧰 Features

- **Interactive Filters**: Narrow down analysis by subsidiary or specific ship.
- **Warm-Up Efficiency Analysis**: Visualize optimal vs non-optimal engine warm-up times.
- **Fuel Consumption Metrics**: Track total fuel used and wasted due to inefficiencies.
- **Financial Loss Calculation**: Estimate USD loss from unnecessary fuel burn.
- **Dynamic Data Grouping**: View aggregated metrics grouped by Ship, Subsidiary, or Port Country.
- **Raw Data Inspection**: Toggle visibility of full dataset breakdown.

## 📊 Dataset Details

The synthetic dataset contains **150 sample entries** representing simulated trips made by cruise ships across various European ports. Each entry includes:

### Columns in the Dataset

| Column Name                   | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `Subsidiary`                  | Cruise line brand (e.g., NCL, Oceania, Regent Seven Seas) |
| `Ship_Name`                   | Name of the ship |
| `Port_Country`                | Country where the port is located |
| `Port_Name`                   | Name of the port |
| `Port_Status`                 | "Busy" or "Normal" indicating current port congestion |
| `Fuel_Used_MetricTons`        | Amount of fuel used during operation |
| `Fuel_Cost_Per_Ton ($)`       | Cost of fuel per metric ton |
| `Engine_WarmUp_Time (mins)`   | Time taken to warm up engines before departure |
| `Optimal_WarmUp_Time (mins)`  | Set threshold for optimal warm-up time (15 mins) |
| `Sailing_Delay_Due_To_Port_Busy` | Indicates whether sailing was delayed due to port congestion |

> ✅ **Note**: This dataset is entirely **synthetically generated** using Python (`numpy`, `pandas`) and does **not rely on any external datasets**, making it fully reproducible and customizable.

### Additional Calculated Fields

- `WarmUp_Status`: Whether warm-up time was optimal or not  
- `Extra_Fuel_Wasted`: Estimated extra fuel burned due to suboptimal warm-up  
- `Financial_Loss_USD`: Calculated financial loss based on wasted fuel and fuel cost
